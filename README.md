Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. This analysis is typically used to identify and categorize opinions expressed in a piece of text, particularly to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, or service is positive, negative, or neutral.
